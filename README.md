# AudioGuru
developed by Akhil Kammela


## What exactly is AudioGuru?
AudioGuru is a Python based application that learns about a user's music taste, and helps predict which of the user's playlist a newly discovered song should be added to.

From a technical view, AudioGuru forms spectrograms with WAV files provided by a user, and utilizes said spectrograms to train a classifier to detect where new songs should be placed amongst a user's library of playlists.

## How does AudioGuru work?


### Essential Packages/Dependencies
> Currently AudioGuru utilizes
> - [Scikit-sound](http://work.thaslwanter.at/sksound/html/)
> - [Pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub)
> - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
> - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
> - [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)
> - [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### Features
> - AG interacts with song spectrograms and consolidates nearly 10 million data points **per song**
> 
> - Trains classifiers with spectrogram data to build a recommendation system (*in progress*)

### Technical Basis
> **How will AG be able to use spectrograms to detect which playlist a song should be placed in ?**




AudioGuru's functionality is comprised of 5 key processes
- 1: Ingestion
- 2: Curation 
- 3: Analytics
- 4: Knowledge System
- 5: Decision Support







## Key Processes
